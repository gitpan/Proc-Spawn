Proc::Spawn provides an interface to run external programs on either
pipes or ptys.  One should use pipes normally, and only use a pty when
running programs like "telnet" or "passwd".

This module has not been tested on versions of Perl prior to 5.6.0.
It may not function correctly.  If you plan to use it with an older
version you will need to edit out the 'require 5.6.0' statement.

After unpacking the distribution, to install this module run:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Documentation is embedded in the module.
